## Test project # 1 - Material UI

- Stack:
   - React  (v 19)
    - TypeScript 
    - Vite
    - Material UI (v. 7.1.2)
    - Joy UI


- Goal:

  Build a dashboard page that shows a table/list of people. Users can add a person
  (new entries appear at the beginning of the list), edit or delete existing people, 
  and filter the list (search, attribute filters). The component should be accessible, 
  test-covered, and integrate with the app's state or backend API.
